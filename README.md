<p align="center">regarding Pony Town—if you would like to tell me something but i am not on the tab/idle, please do feel free to whisper me!! i'm on do not disturb like 12908% of the time HAH usually because i like just having PT going on as i'm doing another task, it just feels nice and helps my brain work fsr pfft
<p align="center">usually i go just . wherever i please (typically in the 18+ server), and come online at extremely late and sporadic times, so i will not be reliable to find o7 however, since my hyperfixation at the moment is currently Persona, i will usually be waltzing around as characters from it (though occasionally I may use Danganronpa or Kingdom Hearts characters!). i do quite like the library, so you may have a higher chance of locating me there (update, you have a significantly higher chance of locating me there, i'm in there A Ton usually at the bench towards the wall underneath the cute little nook). you did find me somehow after all, if you're reading this!!</p>
<p align="center">i hope you have a delightful day or night <333</p>

<p align="center"><sub>as stated above, i may have things related to non-pony-town listed here in the future! keep an eye open or somethin flkajssdkjfs</sub>
